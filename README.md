# Sales-and-Expense-Forecast-Model-Experimentation
This repository contains the notebooks I made from experimenting with different models and approaches to find the most optimal model with the lowest features, and best accuracy.
It's pretty rough, as it wasn't initially a repository, but just a folder on my PC, with time, I'll clean it up.
The end goal for me was to produce a pickle file I can use with the APIs I developed (also in the repository) with Django REST framework.
